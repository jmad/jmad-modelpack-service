# Usage

Since the dependency **jmad-core is not released yet**, the only way to compile the project is to clone the jmad-core project in a sibling directory.

```
├── jmad-core
└── jmad-modelpack-service
```

The Gradle composite build should take care of resolving the jmad-core dependency locally.
