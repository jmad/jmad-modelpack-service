# JMad Modelpackage Service

This service allows to connect to different model repositories, to fetch model definitions from them. Currently, the following sources are supported:

* INTERNAL: This is equivalent to the original concepts, where jmad model definitions are read from the classpath.
* Gitlab Groups: Treats gitlab groups as model package repositories, from which model packages can be fetched.
